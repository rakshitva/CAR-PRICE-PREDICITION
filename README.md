# Car Price Prediction for Geely Auto

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict car prices for the Chinese automobile company Geely Auto, which is planning to enter the Nigerian market. The goal is to understand the factors affecting car pricing in Nigeria and how these differ from the Chinese market. The project involves modeling car prices using a dataset of various car types available in the Nigerian market.

## Problem Statement

Geely Auto intends to set up a manufacturing unit in Nigeria to produce cars locally, competing with Nigerian, US, and European counterparts. The company has hired a data scientist to identify the key factors that influence car prices in Nigeria. The objective is to determine:

- Which variables are significant in predicting car prices?
- How well do these variables explain the variations in car prices?

## Business Goal

The primary objective is to develop a model that predicts car prices based on available independent variables. The insights from this model will help the management team understand how different factors impact pricing. This understanding will enable them to adjust car designs and business strategies to achieve competitive pricing in the Nigerian market.

## Data Collection

Data for this project was gathered from various market surveys across Nigeria. The dataset includes multiple variables that potentially influence car prices, such as:

- Car make and model
- Engine size
- Horsepower
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Car dimensions
- Other relevant features

## Methodology

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution and relationships of the variables.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying significant variables that impact car prices.
4. **Model Development**: Building and testing various models to predict car prices.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, etc.

## Results and Insights

- Identification of key variables affecting car prices in Nigeria.
- Insights into the pricing dynamics of the Nigerian automobile market.
- Recommendations for Geely Auto's market entry strategy based on model findings.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing car prices in the Nigerian market. The predictive model serves as a tool for Geely Auto's management to strategize their market entry and compete effectively with local and international car manufacturers.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Explore advanced modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- Continuous monitoring of market trends to update the model accordingly.
